# Optional. Sets the bucket parameters for cooldown resets (currently sleepy potions and cookies and milk). Try lowering these if you hit global message rate limits.
# Navi checks this when a user uses one of named resets and has auto-ready active. If he uses more resets than the defined amount within the defined timespan (in minutes), auto-ready will be turned off, the user will be informed, and he will be unable to turn it on again for the same timeframe.
# Example: If you set amount 5, minutes 5 and the user uses 6 cookies and milk within 5 minutes, it will turn off auto-ready. He will not be able to turn on auto-ready again for 5 minutes.
# If parameters aren't set, default values (10 resets in 5 minutes) are used.
